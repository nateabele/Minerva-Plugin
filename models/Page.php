 * Minerva Pages & How They Work
 *
 * Pages are the main content items within the CMS. They get stored in a Pages
 * collection where each document record will contain most of the data necessary
 * for any given page for a web site. "Most of" because there could of course
 * be data loaded from external sites or services as well as "block" content.
 *
 * Each Page must have a title, url, created date, modified date, and then a special
 * "page_type" field that tells the system which library created the page. This is how
 * 3rd party add-ons will hook into the CMS without altering Minerva's core code
 * in order to extend functionality. For example, a "blog" library.
 * 
 * What happens is any library with a Page model that extends this base Page model
 * will have its own $_schema and $validate properties appended to the same properties
 * in this base model class. This always guarantees that the base fields and validation
 * will exist so that there will be less issues with consistency and integration.
 * We have to be able to rely upon the fact that each "Page" has a title, url, etc.
 *
 * The Pages controller will be instantiating the library's Page model based on the
 * record pulled (the library field contains the library name). If creating
 * a new page, or calling the index action, the URL would contain the library name.
 *
 * Within each library's extended Page model, not only is its schema and validation
 * rules applied, but any filters within that model will also be applied. It is 
 * through Lithium's filter system that we gain even further control over the
 * CRUD process for pages. You would equate this technique with a "hook" system
 * found in other CMS' such as Drupal, etc.
 *
 * Minerva's core PagesController is used and no additional controller need be setup;
 * however, the library's page view templates will also be used.
 *
 * Don't want to use Lithium's filter system?
 * Want to add new methods to the PagesController?
 * Alternatively, a library could write new routing rules to call it's own PagesController
 * which can extend Minerva's PagesController or just extend Lithium's controller class
 * as normal and not inherit anything from Minerva...Then from there you could skip the
 * entire process of instantiating a Page model from a library and simply put "use" up
 * top to use the library's Page model instead of Minerva's base Page model to pick up
 * schema, validation, and other properties and methods.
 *
 * It's completely possible to use the pages collection and not use any of Minerva's
 * classes to save and read data from it. However, you should use some caution because
 * you could end up with inconsistencies that could create errors.
 * Please understand what Minerva is trying to do if you decide to create your own
 * PagesController. You may even use it as a starting point for your own controller.
 * If you are making a radical change...Then perhaps consider using a completely new model,
 * controller, and database collection to store the data (if there's data to be stored).
 * Remember, Minerva uses MongoDB, but your libraries can use other types of datasources.
